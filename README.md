Presentation Content for "Controlling the Physical World with Raspberry Pi" by Todd Christell

**This month's presentation**

Controlling the physical world with Raspberry Pi - This will be an introduction on using Python to control the GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi to control the physical world.  We will read push buttons, light LEDs, turn on motors and use “advanced” sensors to read temperature and humidity.

**Our Presenter: Todd Christell**

I started building electronic circuits when I was eight years old.  When I got my first VIC-20 rather than writing video games I used the “User Port” to control my home heating and air conditioning.  For the last 10 years I have been working on robotics; except for a slight detour building an Internet enabled microwave oven that was controlled by a Raspberry Pi.
